discord brawl stars link clicker

## Why?
This script was created as a way to quickly enter Brawl Stars matches, in the case where a Brawl Stars invite is sent over Discord. When this script receives a message that a Brawl Stars invite link was sent in a selected Discord channel, it will type the join code using pyautogui then click your mouse. 

## How to set up
You would want to install [Python 3.12.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127/). You need to install [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [discordpy self](https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing). Then, configure the script where it says optionss. You need to input the [channel id](https://youtu.be/YjiQ7CajAgg) of the channel you want to wait for links in. You also need to input your [Discord user token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI). You should NEVER share your Discord token with anyone! Finally, the script is set up and you can use it.
